<p>You can find instructions on downloading and installing the method in the <a href="https://statisticalmethodslibrary.ons.gov.uk/help-centre/access/run-a-method">Help centre</a> of the <a href="https://statisticalmethodslibrary.ons.gov.uk">ONS Statistical Methods Library</a></p>
<h2 id="using-the-method">Using the Method</h2>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Once you have downloaded the sml-small wheel package you will be able to import the T&amp;C method and pass in data.</p>
<p>The TCC markers returned determine if and what the method has corrected.</p>
<ul>
<li>"S" is when the method stops early or the method is not completed</li>
<li>"N" is for no correction</li>
<li>"M" is for manual editing this is where the record needs to be reviewed by a user</li>
<li>"C" is for component correction where the final components are corrected</li>
<li>"T" is for totals correction where the final totals are corrected</li>
</ul>
<p>The core mathematical corrections are total correction and component correction shown below respectively from the methodology specification.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">final_total = sum_of_components
</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">final_component = (original_component / sum_of_components) * total
</code></pre>
<p>It is worth noting these are mutually exclusive and a result of many mathematical and logical steps. Therefore, to get a complete understanding of the above equations it is advisable to read the methodology specification.</p>
<p>From the methodology specification we can see that the method accepts a structured input. The input parameters determine how the method operates and what kind of outputs we would expect from it.</p>
<h3 id="example-run-through">Example Run Through</h3>
<p>Below is a snapshot of an example dataset and how the input data should
look like:</p>

<p>This is constructed from the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique Identifier – Any e.g. Business Reporting Unit</li>
<li>Total Variable – Target period total, numeric</li>
<li>Components Variable – Corresponding list of Total variable's components,
 numeric – nulls allowed</li>
<li>Amend Total – Select whether Total Variable for the target period should be
 automatically corrected, Boolean</li>
<li>Predictive Variable – Previous or current period total, numeric</li>
<li>Precision - The precision value determines the level of accuracy for our floating point calculations</li>
<li>Auxiliary Variable – optional, numeric – nulls allowed</li>
<li>Absolute Difference Threshold - represented as a decimal</li>
<li>Percentage Difference Threshold - represented as a decimal</li>
</ul>
<p>To run the method using the example data above you can create a python file in your desired IDE and do the following below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># To import this method we are first navigating to the
# sml_small/editing/totals_and_components directory and
# the totals_and_components python file
# to import the totals_and_components function.
from sml_small.editing.totals_and_components.totals_and_components import totals_and_components

# We can pass our data into the method and save the output to the
# results variable.
result = totals_and_components(
    identifier=&quot;1&quot;,
    total=1689,
    components=
    [
        (632),
        (732),
        (101),
        (165)
    ],
    amend_total=False,
    predictive=1689,
    precision=10,
    auxiliary=None,
    absolute_difference_threshold=28,
    percentage_difference_threshold=0.1
)

# The output will be returned as an object.
# You will need to destructure the object to extract the values and
# one way of doing this is using the built-in function vars().
# vars() is used to return the __dict__attribute for the specified
# module, class, instance or any other object with a
# __dict__attribute
print(vars(result))
</code></pre>
<p>Running this command will then give you the results from the totals and components area.</p>
<h3 id="example-output">Example Output</h3>
<p>The output data is determined by the TCC marker. Some values would be returned as None if they are not calculated.
The output is as follows:</p>

<p>The breakdown of the received outputs are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique Identifier – Any e.g. Business Reporting Unit</li>
<li>Absolute difference - the absolute difference between the predictive value and the sum of the original components returned as a string, None or NaN type</li>
<li>Lower percentage threshold - the lower threshold calculated for the percentage range returned as a string, None or NaN type</li>
<li>Higher percentage threshold - the higher threshold calculated for the percentage range returned as a string, None or NaN type</li>
<li>Final total - the final total will be corrected if applicable or will remain as the original if not returned as a string, None or NaN type</li>
<li>Final component - the final components will be corrected if applicable, if not it will remain as original components returned as a string, None or NaN type</li>
</ul>
